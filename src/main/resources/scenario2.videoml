Alice needs to do a cast for her work. She needs to:
(a) add an introduction title on a black background at the beginning for 10 seconds.
(b) load a first video clip clip1
(c) create two clips clip1a and clip1b respectively taken from 00:23 to 01:47 min and from 02:01 to 02:21 min.
(d) add clip1a with a subtitle s1 from the beginning and for 10 seconds, followed by another subtitle starting 30 seconds after the end of the first one and visible for 10 seconds.
(e) add clip1b with a subtitle starting 5 seconds before clip1b and lasting for 15 seconds.
(f) add a thanks conclusive text on a fixed background color (letâ€™s say black).
(g) export the result as a video file
